You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word.
If the word's length is odd, return the middle character.
If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#Examples:

getMiddle("test") should return "es"

getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

getMiddle("A") should return "A"
#Input

A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000.
You do not need to test for this.
This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.

#Output

The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.

Test:

def test_get_middle():
    assert fns.get_middle("test") == "es"
    assert fns.get_middle("testing") == "t"
    assert fns.get_middle("middle") == "dd"
    assert fns.get_middle("A") == "A"
    assert fns.get_middle("of") =="of"
