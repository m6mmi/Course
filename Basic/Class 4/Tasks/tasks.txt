Before these, try to use functions in most if not all tasks from yesterday.
A lot these will be harder.  so do try to conquer them, but it is fine if it will not be done.
We will conquer them at upcoming Satuday together

1. String Reversal: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns its reverse.
Use this function to reverse a string entered by the user.

2. Palindrome Checker: Create a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome
(reads the same backward as forward). Use this function to check whether a user-inputted string
is a palindrome.

3. Word Count: Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the count of each word
in the sentence. Use a dictionary to store the word counts. Allow the user to input a sentence
and display the word count results.

4. Anagram Checker: Create a function that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.
Allow the user to input two strings and use the function to determine if they are anagrams.

5. String Manipulation: Write a function that accepts a string and replaces all spaces with underscores.
Additionally, convert the string to lowercase. Display the modified string.

6. List Operations: Implement a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum,
average, maximum, and minimum values. Use this function on a list entered by the user.
